[Role]: Experienced Presentation Designer  
[Goal]: Based on the provided information, select the most appropriate slide layout from `TEMPLATE LAYOUT INFO` for each page, ensuring that you choose a variety of layouts while avoiding overlap as much as possible.

Two key pieces of information are provided: `PRESENTATION CONTEXT INFO` and `TEMPLATE LAYOUT INFO`.

1. Check the contents of `PRESENTATION CONTEXT INFO`.
- <slideCount>: The number of slides in the presentation.
- <audience>: The target audience for the presentation (e.g., elementary students, business professionals).
- <tone>: The desired tone of the presentation (e.g., educational, persuasive).
- <document>: The complete document provided by the user in advance
- <extra_note>: Additional information provided by the user.
- <outline>: A presentation outline created by another expert based on the user's requested presentation topic. The number of slides matches the number of outline items, and each item includes the main topic and subtopics for each slide.

2. Check the contents of `TEMPLATE LAYOUT INFO`.
- This contains the slide-by-slide layout information of the template selected by the user for their presentation.
- It includes details about the purpose of each slide, the number of text boxes, and the number of image frames.
- You can understand the purpose of the text in each text box.
- [Tip]: Most layouts follow this pattern: Slide 1 is the title slide, slides 2-4 are table of contents slides, and slide 5 onwards are content slides.


Now, follow the detailed procedure outlined below.


## Layout Selection Procedure:
**Think step by step, but only keep a minimum draft for each thinking step, with 5 words at most.**

1. Classify the layouts in `TEMPLATE LAYOUT INFO` under the following categories: "Title," "Table of Contents," "Body," and "Conclusion."
- Carefully review the "purpose_of_the_page" for each layout.
- If there are no layouts fitting a specific category, output "None."
- Now, separate the layouts categorized as "Body" according to whether they can be used for general content or not.
  - Non-general-purpose layouts refer to pages designed specifically for purposes such as SWOT analysis, comparison, timeline, graphs, cause and effect, etc.

2. Now, for each outline page, select the most appropriate layout page based on the purpose of the slide.
- For the title slide, choose from layouts categorized as "Title," and for the table of contents page, choose from those categorized as "Table of Contents." For body pages, select from "Body" layouts.
- For the conclusion page, choose from layouts categorized as "Conclusion."
- For summary items such as "Thank you," select from layouts categorized as "Title."
- When choosing the body layout, pay close attention to the "purpose_of_the_page" as a primary consideration. Avoid choosing layouts based on their order alone and instead select the layout that best fits the outline content.
  - For example, a layout designed for comparing two Sub Topics should only be chosen if the outline page contains two contrasting items for comparison.
- Check the number of subtopics or keywords for each page.

3. Avoid selecting the same layout consecutively, as this can lower the overall quality of the presentation. It is advisable to use a variety of layouts whenever possible.
  - [TIP] Using the same layout consecutively is allowed up to a maximum of 2 times.
  - For example, if {"4": 5, "5": "5"}, the layout for page 6 must be different from layout 5.


**Output the results for each step.**

4. The output must be in JSON format and must match the `## Output Format`.
- "Slide page number" must be in string format (enclosed in quotation marks), and Number_of_Layout_Page must be an integer.
- No other data types are allowed.
- The output must be in a single line without line breaks (\n).
- **[Important]: The result must start with a <json> tag.**
  

## FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT
<json>
{Number of Slide page(eg. "1", "2", ...):Number_of_Layout_Page(eg. 1, 4, ...),}
</json>
