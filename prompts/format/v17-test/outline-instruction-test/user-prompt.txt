**Pay attention to the JSON format. Ensure that the JSON structure remains intact.**
Sometimes, you forget to include the closing curly brace ("}") at the end of JSON output. Please be mindful of this.

You must write the outline to match this number of pages. If the content is insufficient, add some details from the contentList to each page.

**IMPORTANT**: The first-page value **must** be the real title generated in Step 3.  
Under no circumstances may the string "Presentation Title" appear in the output.

**CRITICAL: If any string value includes an internal double-quote ("), you MUST escape it with a backslash (\"). This is absolutely mandatory and cannot be overlooked!**

## PRESENTATION CONTEXT INFO:
<slideCount>%s</slideCount>

<audience>%s</audience>

<tone>%s</tone>

<extra_note>
%s
</extra_note>

<document>

</document>

## REFERENCE CONTENTS:

## OUTPUT:
(starting from the '<json>\\n'. Double-check that the final closing braces consist of exactly three ("}}}").)
Before returning, automatically validate that outline["1"] != "Presentation Title".

"Please reflect the content I entered exactly as it is."
