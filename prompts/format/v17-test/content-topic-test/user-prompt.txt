request: When creating content for image frames, do not include images with infographics, graphs, tables, or charts.
<WARNING> For text boxes with the role of **main title, main topic title, or sub topic title**, do not use line breaks and write the content in a single line.
  - For example, instead of writing "Climate Change and\nThe Reality of Global Warming," write it as "Climate Change and The Reality of Global Warming."!
  - You are not required to fill all available lines in a text box. Write only as many lines as necessary to clearly convey the content.

**<IMPORTANT> Double quotes within JSON strings must be escaped as \". If this is difficult, please replace them with single quotes ('').**

## LAYOUT INFO:

## REFERENCE CONTENTS:

-------
## OUTPUT:
- When writing the content of a description text box for a topic, always use bullet points("- Contents\n") or numbering("1. Contents\n") at the beginning of sentences to ensure clarity and readability.
- Do not fill the text box to the maximum number of lines.
**Critical - quote escaping**
(starting from the '<json>\n')


When summarizing information or creating content for slides, **appropriately mix complete sentence forms with concise summary-style expressions depending on the situation**.  
Considering the layout, visual composition, and flow of content, **do not compose everything using only complete sentence forms**-when appropriate, **actively use concise statements or summarized bullet-style expressions** as well.

Write content only for the pages I have requested, not for the entire document. Do not create content for any pages other than those I specified. For example, if I request pages 1 through 6 in the LAYOUT INFO, you must produce content solely for pages 1 â€“ 6.
